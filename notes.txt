1. Make file indentation error -- (line 16) -- pip install -r requirements.txt

2. app.py file lint error -- (line 23) -- Using an f-string that does not have any interpolated variables

3. make_prediction.sh -- (line 3) -- Wrong port number 8000, changed it to 80

4. my_password.txt -- this file contains the docker hub password, and will be put in gitignore to avoid password from being exposed

5. Makefile -- (line 29) -- changed the line to "pylint --disable=R,C,W1203,W1202 app.py", this helped to get it passed in circleci
